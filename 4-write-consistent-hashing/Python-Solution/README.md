## Consitent Hashing algorithm

### Traditional Hashing algorithm

```sh
python traditional_hashing.py
```

```bash
$ python3 traditional_hashing.py

 file f1.txt resides on node E
 file f2.txt resides on node A
 file f3.txt resides on node B
 file f4.txt resides on node C
 file f5.txt resides on node D
 file f6.txt resides on node E
 file f7.txt resides on node A
 file f8.txt resides on node B
 file f9.txt resides on node C
 
 {'E': 2, 'A': 2, 'B': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 1}
 
 file f1.txt resides on node E
 file f2.txt resides on node A
 file f3.txt resides on node B
 file f4.txt resides on node C
 file f5.txt resides on node D
 
 {'E': 1, 'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}
```
